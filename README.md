# Impact-of-Soda-on-Health
scraping data from web using Python to deduce the impact of drinking soda

I had a discussion couple of days back with a collegue who likes to drink non sugary coke. Now he believes that drinking non sugary drink will only have the caffein impact on him but I do not agree with his thought. Moreover I do not want to go thorugh numerous articles to prove my point, hence I decided to cerate a model that will read from say 10-15 articles and conclude the key points from the article.
